How to test Dynamic Partition functionalities

- prerequisites

The Dynamic Partition (dynp) assumes that one batch system cluster
(LSF only, currently) and one Openstack instance (current release) are
deployed and working. Physical machines can be member of the LSF or
the Openstack cluster in a mutually exclusive manner.

Functionalities:

- switch role of selected physical machines from the LSF cluster to
  the Openstack one.

- switch role of selected physical machines from the Openstack cluster
  to the LSF one.

- manage intermediate transition statuses, ensure consistency

Components:

- elim.dynp

This is a custom External Load Information Manager, specific to
LSF,created to enable implementation of the Functionalities and
conformant to the LSF guidelines. It assumes to be properly configured
at batch system side.

- p_switch.py <to_cloud|to_batch> <filename>

This tool triggers role switching for hosts from Batch to Cloud or
vice-versa.  It is provided with a file contining a list of hostnames
whose role is to be switched

- p_driver.py

This script checks for status changes of each host under transition
and takes needed action accordingly. For example, when a host
switching from Batch to Cloud has no more running jobs, it is enabled
to Openstack as a new hypervisor, and from then on, new VM can be
instantiated there by the Nova component.
